Imagine someone coming up to you and saying --> I've got the next greatest idea... Hear me out... Tinder... But for dogs! :)

In this Udemy web developement bootcamp called "The Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp" the instructor (Angela Yu) does a great job at explain the basics of CSS, HTML, & Bootstrap through creating a single page site. The twist here is that the site is for a fake company making a tinder app for dogs. Ha! 

The best part about her tutorials are that they have plenty of challenges stung throughout, so she's contantly stretching you to work on your "Google Fu". :)

Some helpful bits Angela breaks down in this tutorial is...
- Responsive Web Design
- Media Queries
- PLENTY of Bootstrap
- The process of scketching out a website or app prior to diving into the code
- And of course HMTL5

Feel free to checkout the code and site!
